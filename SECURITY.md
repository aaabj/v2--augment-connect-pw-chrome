# Security Guidelines

## Environment Configuration Security

### üîí **Protected Files**
The following files are automatically ignored by git to protect sensitive information:

- `.env` - Contains IP addresses and configuration
- `screenshots/` - May contain sensitive captured data
- `chrome-debug/` - Chrome user data directory

### üõ°Ô∏è **Best Practices**

#### 1. Environment Variables
- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template for team members
- Store production secrets in secure environment variable systems
- Rotate IP addresses and credentials regularly

#### 2. Remote Chrome Connections
- **Use VPN or private networks** for remote Chrome connections
- **Implement authentication** for production remote Chrome instances
- **Use HTTPS/WSS** for secure connections in production
- **Monitor and log** all remote connections

#### 3. Screenshot Security
- Screenshots may contain **sensitive user data**
- Implement **automatic cleanup** of old screenshots
- **Review screenshots** before sharing or storing long-term
- Consider **data masking** for sensitive information

#### 4. Chrome Debug Mode
- Chrome debug mode **disables security features**
- **Never use debug mode** with sensitive browsing data
- Use **isolated user data directories** (`--user-data-dir`)
- **Clean up debug directories** after use

### üö® **Security Checklist**

Before deploying or sharing:

- [ ] `.env` file is not committed to git
- [ ] Remote IP addresses are not hardcoded in source
- [ ] Screenshots directory is cleaned of sensitive data
- [ ] Chrome debug directories are cleaned up
- [ ] Production uses secure connection methods
- [ ] Access logs are monitored
- [ ] Credentials are rotated regularly

### üîß **Secure Configuration Example**

```env
# .env - This file should NEVER be committed
LOCAL_CHROME_PORT=9222
LOCAL_CHROME_HOST=127.0.0.1
REMOTE_CHROME_PORT=9222
REMOTE_CHROME_HOST=10.0.1.100  # Use private IP ranges
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=30000
RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
SCREENSHOT_PATH=./screenshots
```

### üåê **Production Security**

For production deployments:

1. **Use container orchestration** (Docker/Kubernetes)
2. **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
3. **Use secure networks** (VPC, private subnets)
4. **Enable monitoring and alerting**
5. **Regular security audits** and updates
6. **Backup and disaster recovery** plans

### üìû **Reporting Security Issues**

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Contact** the maintainers privately
3. **Provide** detailed reproduction steps
4. **Allow** reasonable time for fixes before disclosure

### üîç **Security Monitoring**

Monitor for:
- Unusual connection patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Excessive resource usage
- Unauthorized screenshot captures
- Chrome process anomalies

Remember: **Security is everyone's responsibility!**
